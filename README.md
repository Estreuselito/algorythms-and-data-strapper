# Algorythms and Data Strapper

> ⌨️ A "Strapper" is defined as an apprentice, a learner or a junior.

This repository contains all the assignments and self-written algorithms and data structures, which I produce during the course Algorithms and Data Structures at the Frankfurt School.

# Assignment time complexity for the get function of the Binary Search Tree (27.09.2020)

> 🌳 Binary Search Tree time complexity

Currently the file ```TC_for_BST.py``` contains the measurement of the time complexity. It can be run from the console and will return once the times and second a plot, which visualizes the time complexity.
